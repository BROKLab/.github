# Important Update: Repository Transition to New Location

Attention All Developers!

We have an important announcement to share with you. The current collection of repositories is being sunset, and development will be moving to a new location.

ðŸ”— New Repository Location: <https://github.com/brreg/>

To ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted development, please follow these steps:

1.  Star and Watch the new repository at <https://github.com/brreg/> to receive updates and notifications.
2.  Update your local clones and remotes to point to the new repository location.
3.  Migrate any open issues or pull requests to the new repository. Detailed instructions can be found in the repository's migration guide.
4.  Spread the word to your fellow developers and collaborators about this important update.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this transition. We're excited about the future of our project and look forward to your continued contributions and collaboration in the new repository.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out in the repository's discussion section or open a new issue.

Thank you for your support, and happy coding! ðŸš€
